compilation of the code
$gcc --ansi encryption.c -o encryption
$./encryption <input.txt>encrypted.txt

$gcc --ansi decryption.c -o decryption
$./encryption <encrypted.txt>decrypted.txt

i added the printed versions of encrypted and decrypted files.
i recommend deleting their contents before compiling to see the result
yourself.
